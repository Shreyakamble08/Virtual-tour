Studio — Luxury Photography (Tailwind + JS)

Preview

- Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or serve with a static server).

Notes

- Tailwind is loaded via the CDN play build — no build step required.
- The hero video currently uses an external Mixkit sample. Replace with your own studio video at `assets/hero.mp4` for best results.
- Fonts: Playfair Display (headings) and Inter (body) are included via Google Fonts.

Files

- `index.html`: single-file site (Home / Portfolio / Contact).

Customization

- Replace portfolio images in the `#portfolio-page` grid with your own images.
- To use a local hero video, add `assets/hero.mp4` alongside the HTML and update the `<source>` if necessary.

Want me to:
- extract inline CSS/JS into `styles.css` and `script.js`? (I can do that now)
- add a sample local `assets/hero.mp4` placeholder? (I cannot create binary files but can point to free sources)
